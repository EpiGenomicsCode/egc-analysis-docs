# Genomic Features Tutorials

Even without NGS sequencing data, there are some analyses you can perform if you have the coordinate annotations for some set of genomic features (e.g. `.bed` or `.gff` -formatted files). If you have more than one set you are looking at, there are comparisons you can do to further examine how they positionally relate to each other.
